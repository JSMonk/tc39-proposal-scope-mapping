This repository contains an example implementation of the algorithm for computing original scopes in a debugger
using scope information encoded in the sourcemap according to [this proposal](https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/issues/37#issuecomment-1650027594).
The algorithm can be found in `src/getOriginalScopes.ts`, the `test` directory contains two examples from [here](https://github.com/tc39/source-map-rfc/issues/37#issuecomment-1699356967).
